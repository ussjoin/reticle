;
; database_name = [ {ParamName, ParamValue}, {ParamName, ParamValue}, ... ]
; _default = [ {ParamName, ParamValue}, {ParamName, ParamValue}, ... ]
;
; Possible parameters:
;
; * db_fragmentation - If the ratio (as an integer percentage), of the amount
;                      of old data (and its supporting metadata) over the database
;                      file size is equal to or greater then this value, this
;                      database compaction condition is satisfied.
;                      This value is computed as:
;
;                           (file_size - data_size) / file_size * 100
;
;                      The data_size and file_size values can be obtained when
;                      querying a database's information URI (GET /dbname/).
;
; * view_fragmentation - If the ratio (as an integer percentage), of the amount
;                        of old data (and its supporting metadata) over the view
;                        index (view group) file size is equal to or greater then
;                        this value, then this view index compaction condition is
;                        satisfied. This value is computed as:
;
;                            (file_size - data_size) / file_size * 100
;
;                        The data_size and file_size values can be obtained when
;                        querying a view group's information URI
;                        (GET /dbname/_design/groupname/_info).
;
; * from _and_ to - The period for which a database (and its view groups) compaction
;                   is allowed. The value for these parameters must obey the format:
;
;                   HH:MM - HH:MM  (HH in [0..23], MM in [0..59])
;
; * strict_window - If a compaction is still running after the end of the allowed
;                   period, it will be canceled if this parameter is set to 'true'.
;                   It defaults to 'false' and it's meaningful only if the *period*
;                   parameter is also specified.
;
; * parallel_view_compaction - If set to 'true', the database and its views are
;                              compacted in parallel. This is only useful on
;                              certain setups, like for example when the database
;                              and view index directories point to different
;                              disks. It defaults to 'false'.
;
; Before a compaction is triggered, an estimation of how much free disk space is
; needed is computed. This estimation corresponds to 2 times the data size of
; the database or view index. When there's not enough free disk space to compact
; a particular database or view index, a warning message is logged.
;
; Examples:
;
; 1) [{db_fragmentation, "70%"}, {view_fragmentation, "60%"}]
;    The `foo` database is compacted if its fragmentation is 70% or more.
;    Any view index of this database is compacted only if its fragmentation
;    is 60% or more.
;
; 2) [{db_fragmentation, "70%"}, {view_fragmentation, "60%"}, {from, "00:00"}, {to, "04:00"}]
;    Similar to the preceding example but a compaction (database or view index)
;    is only triggered if the current time is between midnight and 4 AM.
;
; 3) [{db_fragmentation, "70%"}, {view_fragmentation, "60%"}, {from, "00:00"}, {to, "04:00"}, {strict_window, true}]
;    Similar to the preceding example - a compaction (database or view index)
;    is only triggered if the current time is between midnight and 4 AM. If at
;    4 AM the database or one of its views is still compacting, the compaction
;    process will be canceled.
;
; 4) [{db_fragmentation, "70%"}, {view_fragmentation, "60%"}, {from, "00:00"}, {to, "04:00"}, {strict_window, true}, {parallel_view_compaction, true}]
;    Similar to the preceding example, but a database and its views can be
;    compacted in parallel.
